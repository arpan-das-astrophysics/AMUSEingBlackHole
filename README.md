# AMUSEingBlackHole

### A N-body cosmological simulation code to study the formation of Supermassive Black Hole seeds in dense stellar cluster.

##### This is the official repository for AMUSEinggBlackHole. AMUSEingBlackHole is a N-body code that is able to simulate dense stellar clusters with many star particles. It is super fast and could use a single CPU, CPU cluster, GPU and GPU cluster as per requirement.

#### Key feautres:
..* Accretion recipes: Different accretion recipes e.g., constant accretion, **Bondi-hoyle-lyttleton** accretion and **Eddington** accretion
..* Mass-radii relationship for main sequence stars 
..* Collisions are handled by sticky sphere approximation 
..* Gravitational interactions between the stars are modelled using the N-body code ph4
..* Gravitational effect of the gas cloud is included via an analytical background potential coupled to the N-body code using the BRIDGE method
