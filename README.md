# AMUSEingBlackHole

### A N-body cosmological simulation code to study the formation of Supermassive Black Hole seeds in dense stellar cluster.

##### This is the official repository for AMUSEinggBlackHole. AMUSEingBlackHole is a N-body code that is able to simulate dense stellar clusters with many star particles. It is super fast and could use a single CPU, CPU cluster, GPU and GPU cluster as per requirement.
